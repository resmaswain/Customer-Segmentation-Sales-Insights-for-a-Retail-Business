# Customer-Segmentation-Sales-Insights-for-a-Retail-Business

Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Customer Segmentation on the Online Retail dataset.
The analysis uncovers top products, seasonal sales patterns, high-value customer segments, and geographic distribution of revenue.
Insights are presented through visualizations and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, enabling targeted marketing and upselling strategies.

python analysis.py --data_path /path/to/Online_Retail.xlsx --sheet "Year 2009-2010"
📝 Assumptions Made
The dataset used is Online Retail (UCI Machine Learning Repository) containing invoice-level transactions.

Negative quantities represent returns/cancellations and are excluded from analysis.

Missing CustomerID values are dropped for RFM segmentation.

RFM segmentation quartiles are calculated within the dataset timeframe without external time adjustments.

Currency and price values are assumed to be in GBP.

💻 Technologies Used
Python 3.9+

Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – Visualization

NumPy – Numeric computations

Scikit-Learn – Optional KMeans clustering for customer segmentation

OpenPyXL – Excel file handling

📊 Approach
Data Loading & Cleaning

Read Excel dataset

Remove null CustomerID values

Remove negative/zero Quantity or UnitPrice

Parse InvoiceDate as datetime

Compute TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top products by sales

Monthly revenue trends

Top countries by revenue (excluding UK)

Customer Segmentation – RFM Analysis

Calculate Recency, Frequency, Monetary values per customer

Assign quartile scores to segment customers into groups

Identify high-value segments for targeted campaigns

Optional KMeans Clustering

Scale RFM data

Find optimal cluster count (Elbow method)

Plot customer clusters for visual segmentation

Visualizations

Bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots

Exported to figures/ folder
